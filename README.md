### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm starting to get more comfortable with grids, and with using variables in css to make styling easier. 

I'm also learning that coding for mobiles first makes it easier and quicker to add stylings for bigger screens, whereas as I normally do (from larger to smaller screens) you end up needing more and messier code. 

### Continued development

I will keep practising grids, and I feel like I'm starting to make smarter choices when it comes to styling (like which classes or variables to use to make the styling quicker) but I'm sure I could be doing so much better, so I'm going to be mindful about this aspect in the future.
